Terraform module to provision ECS service with daemon scheduling strategy.


---


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).









## Introduction

This module helps to provision ECS service scheduled on ECS container instances (EC2) daemon scheduling strategy.
It can be useful when you need to run a software on every EC2 host in your ECS cluster, e.g. host monitoring agents,
service discovery agents, log collectors etc.

This module is backed by best of breed terraform modules maintained by [Cloudposse](https://github.com/cloudposse).

## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/aleks-fofanov/terraform-aws-ecs-service-task-daemonset/releases).


This example creates an ECS cluster service scheduled with daemon scheduling strategy:

```hcl
module "daemon_service" {
  source     = "git::https://github.com/aleks-fofanov/terraform-aws-ecs-service-task-daemonset?ref=master"
  name       = "daemon"
  namespace  = "cp"
  stage      = "prod"

  ecs_cluster_arn = "XXXXXXXXXXX"

  container_definition_json = "${module.container_definition.json}"
  container_name            = "daemon"
  task_cpu                  = "256"
  task_memory               = "512"
}
```




## Examples

### Example With Container Definition
This example provisions Fluent ECS services scheduled as a daemon on every ECS container instance (EC2):
```hcl
module "fluentd_container_definition" {
  source                       = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-container-definition?ref=master"
  container_name               = "fluentd"
  container_image              = "aleksfofanov/ecs-datadog-logs-aggregator:0.1.0"
  container_memory             = "512"
  container_memory_reservation = "512"
  container_cpu                = "256"

  port_mappings = [
    {
      containerPort = "24224"
      hostPort      = "24224"
      protocol      = "udp"
    },
    {
      containerPort = "24224"
      hostPort      = "24224"
      protocol      = "tcp"
    },
  ]
}
module "fluentd_logs_aggregator" {
  source     = "git::https://github.com/aleks-fofanov/terraform-aws-ecs-service-task-daemonset?ref=tags/0.1.0"
  name       = "fluentd"
  namespace  = "cp"
  stage      = "prod"

  ecs_cluster_arn = "XXXXXXXXXXX"

  container_definition_json = "${module.fluentd_container_definition.json}"
  task_cpu                  = "256"
  task_memory               = "512"
}
```
